<h1>The Best Movies According to Anne</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>This probably my all-time favorite. I have watched the movies over and over again since I was a kid
    and I will probably watch them over and over again until the day I die.</p>
<p>Why do I love it I hear you ask? That's why:
    <li>It's funny</li>
    <li>It's creative and thus magical</li>
    <li>It's comforting</li>
</p>
<h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
<p>Also a wonderful triology.</p>
<h3>Downton Abby</h3>
<p>Having loved the TV-Series I absolutely love the movies as well. I love diving into english history.</p>
